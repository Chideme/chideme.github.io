Welcome I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Information Engineering at National Kaohsiung University of Science and Technology. With a multidisciplinary background spanning information science and finance, my work focuses on the intersection of evolutionary computation and reliable systems.

My Research
======
 My research centers on AI Safety and Validation. While I initially worked with evolutionary methods to optimize financial trading systems, I have pivoted toward a critical challenge in modern AI: reliability. I am currently building frameworks that employ evolutionary algorithms to validate, falsify, and ensure the safety of complex data-driven systems.

My Background
======
I hold a Master of Science in Information and Finance Management from National Taipei University of Technology. During my master's studies, I explored the synergy between algorithmic theory and financial application, specifically optimizing trading strategy portfolios using genetic algorithms. This foundation in high-stakes optimization now drives my doctoral work in system safety.
