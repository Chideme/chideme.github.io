excerpt: 'Portfolio diversification is a perennial problem in finance. Identifying assets that offer uncorrelated returns
is important for minimizing risk. To solve the problem, this paper proposes the Q-Group Trading Strategy
Portfolio Optimization (QGTSPO) approach to increase the diversity of trading strategies for generating a
QGTSP. QGTSPO extends the previous approach by modeling relationships between trading strategies using
both correlation and mutual information, integrating a threshold component to determine optimal connectivity
in the adjacency matrix. In other words, QGTSPO conceptualizes trading strategies as nodes in a graph and
utilizes the grouping genetic algorithm to group similar nodes using modularity as a fitness measure. It
first applies technical indicators and multiple financial datasets to generate candidate trading strategies with
differentiated risk factors. The selected trading strategies are then used to generate chromosomes to initialize
the population. Every possible QGTSP is encoded by the threshold, the take-profit and stop-loss, the grouping,
and the weight parts. Next, the fitness value of a chromosome is evaluated by the Sharpe ratio, the modularity
of the grouping structure, and the group balance. Extensive experiments on financial datasets from the New
York Stock Exchange and Taiwan Stock Exchange demonstrate that QGTSPO achieves superior performance
compared to the previous approach in terms of volatility reduction, crisis management, and consistency risk-
adjusted returns, making it ideal in high-volatility markets and for investors with stringent risk management
goals.'
